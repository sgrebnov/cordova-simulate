### 0.1.3 (Aug 16, 2015)
* Sim host logic for handling `exec` calls now mirrors app host logic ([f9ae6ab](https://github.com/TimBarham/cordova-simulate/commit/f9ae6ab)).
* Renamed `sim-host-controls` files to `sim-host` and `sim-app-host` files to `app-host` ([c9f08c1](https://github.com/TimBarham/cordova-simulate/commit/c9f08c1)).
* Removed unnecessary `html`, `head` and `body` elements from plugin html files ([9848718](https://github.com/TimBarham/cordova-simulate/commit/9848718)).

* IE support: No longer use HTML Imports to include plugin UI - instead include plugin HTML when the main sim host page is served ([fbac853](https://github.com/TimBarham/cordova-simulate/commit/fbac853)).
* IE support: Set display to `''` instead of `null` or `'initial'` when un-hiding elements, so dialogs now display ([4d3cc52](https://github.com/TimBarham/cordova-simulate/commit/4d3cc52)).
* IE support: Camera plugin now passes picture as raw binary data, and object URL is created on the app host side (previous approach didn't work in IE) ([57f8689](https://github.com/TimBarham/cordova-simulate/commit/57f8689)).
* IE support: When the server tries to pipe a call from app host to sim host or vice versa, and the target host has not yet connected, it stores the call and makes it when the target ultimately connects ([3dd8539](https://github.com/TimBarham/cordova-simulate/commit/3dd8539)).
